# A demo web app using LLM to generate stories

This project showcases how an LLM can be used to write a story, sentence by
sentence. At each step, three options are generated by the LLM to choose from to
continue the story.

The free tier of Gemini Flash is used via HTTPS calls. The project is deployed
on Vercel using a free Vercel account.
